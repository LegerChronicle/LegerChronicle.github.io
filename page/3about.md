Hello there!

We are a student-led extracurricular that meets every Monday in room 128 to discuss and plan each new issue of the paper.

New members are always welcomed to drop in, and general student submissions and inquiries can be sent to legerchronicle@gmail.com. See the 'Contact Us' page for more details.

This all started when we (the editors) wanted to create a year-round club that pushes students to collaborate on a project to produce tangible results in the form of an online newspaper. We wanted to document the daily goings-on of our school community so that no one is left uninformed and to provide a platform for students to be able to freely express their views and opinions, among other things. Thus, The LÃ©ger Chronicle was born. 

We thank you for your support and patronage! Our next issue will be out in the new year. 

est. November 4th, 2019.
